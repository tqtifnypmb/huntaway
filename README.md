## Introduction

Huntaway is a Swift HTTP client inspired by *How complex it is to make a simple http request using NSURLSession*.
Huntaway's goal is: 
- Make a HTTP request is as simple as calling a function.
- No complex configuration needed

## Documentation

###HTTPClient

HTTPClient is centra of Huntaway. Reqeusts are constructed by HTTPClient, sent through HTTPClient. Responses are
generated by HTTPClient.

You can use shared instance of HTTPClient
```
    let client = HTTPClient.sharedHTTPClient()
```

Or, you can create a new instance
```
    let client = HTTPClient()
```

###Request

Request represent a HTTP request which is going to be sent. You need this only when you want to do some configurate
before the request's sent.

```
    let request = client.prepareRequest(url, method)

    // Set headers for this request
    request.setHeaders(headers)

    // Set cookies for this request
    request.setCookies(cookies)

```

###Response

Response represent a HTTP response.

You get a response by sending a request
```
    let resp = HTTPClient.sharedHTTPClient().send(request)

    // or

    let resp = HTTPClient.sharedHTTPClient().get(url)
```

Set hook for response data
```

    // Called when response begin. This can be called once
    resp.onBegin() {
    }
    
    // Called everytime new data is received or sent. 
    resp.onProcess() { progress in
    }

    // Called once download complete
    resp.onDownloadComplete() { url in 
    }

    // Called once response complete
    resp.onComplete() { (resp, error) in
    }

```

Finally, you have to tick the response to let things actually happen
```
    resp.tick()
```

### Auth

    Huntaway currently supports *HTTP Basic Auth* and *HTTP Digest Auth*. You can use it in two ways, *globally* or *per request*.
```
    // globally

    let client = HTTPClient()
    client.config.auth.basic(user: xxx, passwd: xxx, url: xxx).apply()

    // per request

    let request = HTTPClient.sharedHTTPClient().prepareRequest(url, method)
    request.basicAuth(user: xxx, passwd: xxx)

    // or
    request.digestAuth(user: xxx, passwd: xxx)
```

## Usage

- Basic Pattern
```
    // GET
    HTTPClient.sharedHTTPClient().get("https://www.google.com")?.tick() { (response, error) in
        // do something with the response
    }

    // POST
    HTTPClient.sharedHTTPClient().post("https://www.google.com", "data_to_post")?.tick() { (response, error) in
        //...
    }

    // DOWNLOAD
    HTTPClient.sharedHTTPClient().download("https://www.google.com")?.tick() { (resp, error) in
        //...
    }
    // so on
    ...
```

- Configuration Pattern

```

    let client = HTTPClient()
    
    // proxy
    client.config.proxy.setHost(xxx).setPasswd(xxx).setPort(xxx).apply()
    
    // config
    client.config.shouldSetCookies(true).additonalHeaders(xxx).apply()
    
```
